"loc:8bc344e5-637a-469d-ba9c-858031d22862","phloroglucinol","White to yellowish crystals that are used to detect the presence of mechanical wood pulp in paper. Phloroglucinol test solution contains Hydrochloric acid and ethanol. A drop placed on the paper will turn red when Lignin is present (detection limit is about 5%). Iron will react with phloroglucinol giving a purple product. Once the two-part solution is mixed, it has a shelf life of 2-3 months (TAPPI T401)."
"loc:39ca6403-e95f-4c04-b723-d09db41b32df","Lascaux 303","A trademark for a thermoplastic acrylic resin composed of a water-based dispersion of butyl acrylate and methylmethacrylate thickened with acrylic butylester. The minimum film formation temperature for Lascaux Acrylic Adhesive 360 HV is approximately 0°C. It dries to form a film that is more flexible and elastic than 498HV. The dry film is slightly tacky and can be used as a weak pressure sensitive adhesive or it can be activated to improve adhesion with toluene, alcohol or heat (50-55°C). The emulsion can be thinned with water, but once the film is dried it is insoluble in water. Lascaux 360 HV is used as an adhesive for lining paintings and textiles."
"loc:2dbef787-0247-444c-ba31-abc2093976c5","heat set tissue","A lens tissue especially prepared for use in mending tears in paper, strengthening margins, and for laminating weak or badly torn leaves, by means of dry application rather than by the traditional aqueous application. The tissue is made of pure cellulose consisting of more or less lOO% rag content, no coating or additives, and a pH of 7.0. The tissue is not structurally uniform in texture, consequently there are small random open spaces and some bunching of fibers. Although its thickness is presumed to be approximately 0.0015 inch, this can vary from one batch to another, although it does not normally exceed 0.002 inch. The tissue is coated on one side with an acrylic resin. It is applied to both sides of tears, but to only one side of a weakened leaf, provided that no adhesive is exposed on the other side. The tissue is tipped on the leaf with a warm iron (approximately 100° F.), and then pressed on firmly through terylene or a textured paper. The iron is not pressed directly on the heat-set tissue because this might result in blocking and may also impart a sheen to the tissue, thus making it more noticeable. "
"loc:11bd839e-8791-40df-af1f-fefad0efc840","parchment size","A resizing material made from scraps of parchment. It is prepared by boiling 21 grams of parchment scraps soaked in 2 1/2 liters of water for 45 minutes, or longer if a stronger size is required. It is used at a temperature of 35 to 45° C. for resizing archival papers that have been washed. An alkaline buffering agent is sometimes added to the size to provide an alkaline reserve in the paper."
"loc:ed7578d5-5a77-41a1-a84a-0052aa625edf","recase","In a strict sense, a text block that is separated from its case, and, following repair to text block and case, is then placed back into the same case, perhaps with new endpapers, or possibly simply with new hinges. In a more general sense, a book is recased when the text block is removed from its original case (usually a publisher's binding) and placed in a new case made specifically for it. The first method might be said to be the work of the hand binder, and the second the work of the library binder. (69 , 94 )"
"loc:2ae4e361-0277-4ea9-9e9d-6c93c8431ffd","rebinding","The more-or-less complete rehabilitation of a worn and/or damaged book, the minimum amount of work involving resewing and the attachment of new covers. For the general steps in rebinding a book, see: BOOKBINDING . "
"loc:8c2d0794-04d9-4239-98ea-1cfc9652e161","resewing","The process of removing a text block from its case or covers, removing the spine lining (if any), old adhesive, as well as the original sewing thread, and then resewing the sections. In conservation bookbinding, ""resewing"" usually implies the same method of sewing as the original; in library binding, however, the term generally implies the substitution of OVERSEWING for edition sewing. (130 )"
"loc:eee3ad7b-96d6-4d3b-8713-89da34d675e0","pastel","Pastel is a class of fabricated drawing stick produced in a wide, virtually continuous array of colors (a full-palette medium). Pastels consist of finely ground pigments or colorants and fillers mixed with a relatively small amount of binder (typically a carbohydrate, although the amount and type of binder can vary across the range of materials marketed as pastels)."
